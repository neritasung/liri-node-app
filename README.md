# liri-node-app
This is an app that will help you see all my tweets in my Twitter account, search movie information from the OMDB API, seach song's information you are listing to on Spotify NPM, and let liri do its thing.

First, you need to type "node liri.js" and a space before each command below.

1) If you would like to see my tweets, simply just type "my-tweets" to see them,

3) Or type "movie-this" and the name of the movie you want more information on,
